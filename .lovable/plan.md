# YC Demo Video Strategy (3 Minutes)

## Core Narrative

Your YC application positions Formo as **"software that turns custom furniture ideas into factory-ready outputs"**. The demo must prove this claim end-to-end in 3 minutes. Every second should reinforce: **"Designs that factories can actually build."**

---

## Recommended Demo Script

### Act 1: The Problem (0:00 - 0:20)

**What to show:** Nothing on screen yet. Voiceover only, or a simple title card.

**Script direction:**
> "Custom furniture breaks between design and production. Files get reworked, costs change late, factories reject what they can't build. We fix that."

**Why:** YC reviewers watch hundreds of videos. Get to the point immediately. Your application already states the problem clearly -- don't belabor it.

### Act 2: Idea to Manufacturable Output (0:20 - 1:40) -- THE CORE DEMO

This is the heart of the video. Show the Design Studio doing what no other tool does.

**Sequence 1: Text to Design (0:20 - 0:50)**
- Open the Design Studio (`/design-studio`)
- Select a category (e.g., "Benches")
- Type a natural language prompt: *"A flowing bench inspired by ocean waves, with a continuous curve seat"*
- Click Generate -- show 3 variations appearing in ~30 seconds
- Highlight: the AI is constrained to generate only forms that are structurally sound and manufacturable (solid, continuous, monolithic -- no lattice/mesh)

**Sequence 2: Sketch to Design (0:50 - 1:10)**
- Upload a rough hand-drawn sketch
- Show the AI interpreting the sketch into a production-viable design
- Quick comparison: rough sketch on left, refined manufacturable output on right

**Sequence 3: Dimensions and Pricing -- The "Factory-Ready" Proof (1:10 - 1:40)**
- Select a variation
- Enter custom dimensions (e.g., 120cm W x 45cm D x 50cm H)
- Show the system auto-calculating:
  - Manufacturing Base Price (AI-computed based on volume, category, complexity)
  - Designer's selling price (markup)
  - Designer earnings (70% of markup)
- This is the moment that proves **"designs that factories can actually build"** -- the system outputs structured specs, not just pictures

---

### Act 3: From Design to Product (1:40 - 2:20)

**Sequence 4: 3D Model Generation (1:40 - 2:00)**
- Click "Generate 3D Model" on the selected variation
- Show the 3D model rendering (or use a pre-generated one to save time)
- Spin it in the 360-degree viewer
- This demonstrates: the output is not a flat image -- it is a dimensional, inspectable object

**Sequence 5: AR Preview (2:00 - 2:10)**
- Switch to AR tab
- Upload a room photo
- Show the furniture placed in a real space
- Quick beat -- proves the design is spatially validated

**Sequence 6: Design Submission (2:10 - 2:20)**
- Show the submission form with AI-generated product title and description
- Click submit -- design goes to admin review queue
- One sentence: *"Every design is reviewed for manufacturability before it goes live."*

---

### Act 4: The Platform Effect (2:20 - 2:50)

**Sequence 7: Admin Approval (2:20 - 2:35)**
- Switch to Admin Panel (`/admin`)
- Show the pending product in the Products tab
- Demonstrate: admin reviews the design, adjusts manufacturing base price if needed (auto-markup recalculates)
- Click Approve
- Key point: *"Approval automatically publishes to the marketplace and community feed."*

**Sequence 8: Live on Marketplace (2:35 - 2:50)**
- Show the product now live on the Browse page (`/browse`)
- Click into the Product Detail page showing: image, 3D view, dimensions, pricing, "Add to Cart"
- Flash the Community feed (`/community`) showing the auto-published post
- One sentence: *"The designer earns 70% of their markup on every sale, forever."*

---

### Act 5: Close (2:50 - 3:00)

**Script direction:**
> "One workflow. Idea to factory-ready output. No rework, no ambiguity, no rejected designs. This is Formo."

Show the homepage briefly with the "Active Creators" count and the "Start Designing with AI" CTA.

## Technical Preparation Checklist

Before recording, make sure:

1. **Pre-generate a good design** -- have a compelling bench or chair ready in the Design Studio so the AI generation looks instant (you can show real generation, but have a fallback)
2. **Have a 3D model ready** -- 3D generation takes time; pre-generate one so you can show the 360-degree view smoothly
3. **Log into a designer account** (e.g., Tejal's account) for the Design Studio sequence
4. **Log into an admin account** for the approval sequence
5. **Have at least one product in "pending" status** ready for the admin approval demo
6. **Clear browser notifications/toasts** -- no error pop-ups during recording
7. **Use desktop resolution** (1920x1080) for clean visuals
8. **Close all other browser tabs** to avoid distractions

## What NOT to Include

Given 3 minutes, deliberately skip:

- Homepage tour (wastes time -- go straight to the studio)
- Creator onboarding/signup flow (not the core value prop)
- Payment/checkout flow (Razorpay integration is commodity)
- Creator earnings dashboard (mention earnings verbally, don't demo the page)
- Plans/pricing page
- Testimonials or social proof sections

## Key YC Alignment Points

Your application says specific things the demo must validate:

| YC Application Claim | Demo Proof |
|---|---|
| "Turns custom furniture ideas into factory-ready outputs" | Text prompt produces manufacturable design with dimensions and pricing |
| "Computes manufacturability upfront" | AI pricing engine calculates MBP from dimensions and category |
| "Designs, constraints, pricing, and production logic live in one place" | Single Design Studio workflow: design, dimensions, pricing, 3D model, submission |
| "Replaces back-and-forth with a single workflow" | End-to-end: prompt to approved marketplace listing in one session |
| "Designers describe a piece, system converts to structured specs" | Show dimension entry, auto-pricing, AI-generated descriptions |

## Pacing Guide

```text
0:00 - 0:20  Problem statement (voiceover)         [20 sec]
0:20 - 0:50  Text-to-design generation              [30 sec]
0:50 - 1:10  Sketch-to-design                       [20 sec]
1:10 - 1:40  Dimensions + pricing engine             [30 sec]
1:40 - 2:00  3D model generation + viewer            [20 sec]
2:00 - 2:10  AR preview                              [10 sec]
2:10 - 2:20  Design submission                       [10 sec]
2:20 - 2:35  Admin approval                          [15 sec]
2:35 - 2:50  Live on marketplace + community         [15 sec]
2:50 - 3:00  Close                                   [10 sec]
```

The longest beats are on the core differentiators: design generation and the pricing/dimensions engine. Everything else moves fast to show breadth without losing depth.
